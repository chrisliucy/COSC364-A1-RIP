# COSC364-A1-RIP
Internet Technology and Engineering

It is a programming project in which you implement parts of the RIP routing protocol and run several instances of a RIP demon under the Linux operating system on the same machine â€“ each instance runs as a separate process, and these processes communicate through local sockets. You will emulate a small network and explore the response of the RIP protocol to different types of faults.
